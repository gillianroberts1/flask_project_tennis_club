#### BRIEF

I have been asked by a new local tennis club to design a booking system to keep track of all members and courts.


#### MVP

* The app should allow the user to create and edit courts
* It shoudl allow the user to create and edit members
* it should allow the user to book members onto courts
* it should allow the user to view all bookings, by member, by court and view all.

#### Extensions
 * Courts should have a maximum capacity (singles and doubles) and users can only be added whilst there are spaces remaining
 * the club could be able to give members premium or standard membership. Standard members can only be signed up for off peak courts.
 * The club could mark its members as acitive/deactivated. Deactivated members will not show in the create bookings.
 * add more details about member, address, dob, contact details, opt in marketing

#### Advanced Extensions
* add ability to rent out equipment such as racquets and balls 
* add profile photo of each member
* allow court to be booked for one hour or two hours
* be able to record the winner of each match
